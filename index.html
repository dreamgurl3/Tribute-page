        <p>In my opinion, Jackie is an incredible and honorable man. He was actor in more than 140 movies
            throughout his
            life so far.
            Even though he is no longer doing too much appearing in movies anymore, he is still very much active
            in
            producing films for us to enjoy. if you have time you can
